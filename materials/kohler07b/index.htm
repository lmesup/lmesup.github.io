Surveys from inside: An assessment of unit  nonresponse bias with internal criteria
</h1>

<p> This is the documentation page for "Ulrich Kohler (2007):
  Surveys from inside: An assessment of unit  nonresponse bias with 
  internal criteria. Survey Research Methods 1 (2) </p>

<p> On this page you may found all Stata do-files for the analyses in
the paper. The names of the do-files required for each analysis are cited
in the paper. </p>

<p> With the <a href = "master.do"> master do-file</a> you can
replicate every analysis of the paper. For this you need to download
all do-files. This is most easily be done with the following Stata
commands</p>


<tt>
. net from http://kohler.wzb.de/pub/repreas07/
<br>
. net get do
</tt>

<p> In what follows you find the complete list of the
do-files. They appear in the order of their making during the preparation of
the paper.</p>

"Social Conditions ..." , for which materials can be found
